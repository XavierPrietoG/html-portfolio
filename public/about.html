<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Xavier Prieto, a passionate individual with a journey fueled by curiosity and innovation. I embarked on my educational journey at Tecnológico de Monterrey University in Chihuahua, where I pursued my dream of understanding the intricate world of mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>During my academic years, I honed my skills and delved deep into the complexities of mechanical systems and their applications. The foundation I built at Tecnológico de Monterrey University not only equipped me with technical knowledge but also instilled in me a drive to seek practical experiences that would truly shape my career.</p>
<p>After completing my studies, I embarked on a professional adventure as a Commissioning Engineer at Etxetar, a prominent CNC machine manufacturer. It was here that I discovered my passion for programming. I was drawn to the world of numerical control and the art of turning code into tangible, precise movements. Working on these CNC machines, I experienced the exhilarating blend of technology, engineering, and creativity firsthand.</p>
<p>My journey then led me to Ford, where I assumed the role of a Process Engineer. In this dynamic environment, I not only refined my technical skills but also took on the challenge of leading large-scale manufacturing projects. The experience pushed me to my limits and taught me the art of effective project management, teamwork, and problem-solving under pressure.</p>
<p>Amidst my professional endeavors, I realized my fervor for creation was not confined to mechanical systems alone. This realization spurred me to pursue a new path one that merged my technical background with my creative aspirations. The world of Full Stack Development beckoned, and I heeded the call.</p>
<p>Driven by my insatiable love for creating, I delved into the world of Full Stack Development. Learning to craft both the front-end and back-end of digital solutions allowed me to channel my creativity and technical expertise in equal measure. The process of transforming ideas into interactive, functional applications was nothing short of exhilarating.</p>
<p>Today, I find myself at a pivotal juncture, poised to transition my journey towards a focused goal. With my mechanical engineering background, programming expertise, and unyielding passion for creation, I am resolutely steering myself towards a career as a Full Stack Developer. This transformation isn't just about learning new skills; it's a natural evolution that aligns with my deep-seated desire to combine technical prowess with creative innovation.</p>
<p>My sights are set on becoming a proficient Full Stack Developer, using my diverse experiences to craft immersive and efficient digital solutions. The prospect of creating engaging user interfaces while seamlessly integrating them with powerful back-end functionalities exhilarates me. By immersing myself in this realm, I'm not only chasing a career path; I'm pursuing a purpose to contribute meaningfully to the digital landscape and bring ideas to life through lines of code.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey. As I work towards establishing myself as a Full Stack Developer, I am eagerly embracing every opportunity to learn, grow, and create in a field that truly resonates with my passions and aspirations.</p>
